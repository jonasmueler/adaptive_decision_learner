# adaptive_decision_learner
The following model is used to predict binary response outcomes in probabilitsic inference tasks. The model simulates adaptive response behaviors that are based on over 
and underconfidence in a decision implemented in a leraning process. 

In the create stimuli file stimuli can be cretaed based on "validities" of cues. These correspond to the number of times they appear in the stimulus environment. 

The second file contains the full model.
